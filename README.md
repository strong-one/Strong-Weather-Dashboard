# Strong-Weather-Dashboard

Everybody needs to check the weather especially in Colorado where it can blizzaard one day then be sunny and beautiful the next. I have created a weather dashboard that the user can search up any city and the webpage will populate with the city, temperature, humidity and wind speed. Below that it will show a 5 day forecast. This assignment I used bootsrtap to create the header and search bar. and populated the forecast and main weather card using javascript. I continue to learn more about javascript and the different ways and methods that I can use to achieve my end result. My tutor has been a huge help in really getting my head wrapped around some of these difficult concepts and new terminology that come with javascript and combining them with using APIs to incorporate them within my code.
